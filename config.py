# These IDs are ESSENTIAL. The bot will not work without them.
# How to get IDs: In Discord, go to User Settings > Advanced > enable Developer Mode.
# Then, right-click on your server icon or a channel name and select "Copy ID".

# (Required)
GUILD_ID = 0           # PASTE YOUR SERVER'S ID HERE.
CHAT_CHANNEL_ID = 0    # PASTE the ID of your main chat channel. The bot will post announcements here (joins, bans, etc.).
COMMAND_CHANNEL_ID = 0 # PASTE the ID of the text channel where users will type commands like !skip.
STREAMING_VC_ID = 0    # PASTE the ID of the voice channel where the Omegle stream happens and camera rules are enforced.
PUNISHMENT_VC_ID = 0   # PASTE the ID of a "jail" voice channel. Users are moved here for their first camera violation.

# (Optional)
ALT_VC_ID = None             # (Optional) PASTE the ID of a SECOND voice channel where camera rules should also be enforced. Set to None if you don't have one.
AUTO_STATS_CHAN = None       # (Optional) PASTE the ID of a channel for daily automatic VC time reports. Set to None to have it post in CHAT_CHANNEL.
MEDIA_ONLY_CHANNEL_ID = None # (Optional) PASTE the ID of a channel where the bot will delete non-media messages. Set to None to disable.

# --- üëë SERVER OWNER PERMISSIONS üëë ---
# Controls who can use the most powerful bot commands (e.g., !shutdown, !ban).
# Add ONLY Server Owner USER ID (unless you know what you are doing).
# To get a user ID, right-click their name and "Copy ID".
# Example: ALLOWED_USERS = {987654321098765432} or {98765432109776546, 123456788932464}
ALLOWED_USERS = {123456789012345678}

# --- üõ°Ô∏è ROLE CONFIGURATION üõ°Ô∏è ---
# List the EXACT names of roles that should have semi-admin-level command access.
# Case-sensitive! Example: ADMIN_ROLE_NAME = ["Moderator", "Server Admin"]
ADMIN_ROLE_NAME = ["Admin", "Moderator"]

# A set of user IDs to completely exclude from all statistical tracking (VC time, command usage).
# NOTE: All bots are automatically excluded by the code. This setting is for excluding the omegle host.
STATS_EXCLUDED_USERS = {}

# --- ‚öôÔ∏è GENERAL BOT SETTINGS ‚öôÔ∏è ---
# If True, the bot will delete any message in the MEDIA_ONLY_CHANNEL_ID that isn't a picture, video, or link.
MOD_MEDIA = False

# --- üåê BROWSER AUTOMATION (SELENIUM) üåê ---
# These settings control the web browser that runs the Omegle stream.
# The URL the bot will open. Change only if you use a different Omegle mirror.
OMEGLE_VIDEO_URL = "https://uhmegle.com/video"

# If True, the bot will automatically pause/refresh the Omegle stream when the last user with a camera leaves the STREAMING_VC_ID.

# The FULL path to your Microsoft Edge "Profile" folder. This is crucial for the 
# browser to remember settings, stay logged into sites, and appear less like a bot.
#
# HOW TO FIND IT:
#  1. Open Edge and go to `edge://version/`
#  2. Copy the entire "Profile path". 
#     - It will look something like: 
#       C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Profile 3
#     - If you don't use profiles, it might end in `\Default` instead of `\Profile 3`
#
# HOW TO FORMAT IT:
#  - Replace every single backslash `\` with a double backslash `\\`.
#  - Enclose the entire path in quotes.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR = "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Profile 3"
# EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR = "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default"
#
# TIP FOR A DEDICATED BOT PROFILE:
# You can enter a path to a profile that doesn't exist yet, like "Profile 10".
# The bot will create a new, clean profile folder when it starts. You can then
# open Edge with that profile to customize it (e.g., install extensions like Chromegle).
EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR = "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Profile 3"
