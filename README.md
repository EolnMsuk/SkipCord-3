## ‚ú® Key Features

### üåê Interactive Stream Control

  * **Intuitive Button Menus**: Users control the stream (`!skip`, `!info`) and music (`!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`) with persistent button menus that periodically refresh.
  * **Global Hotkeys**: Configure system-wide keyboard shortcuts to trigger commands like `!skip`, `!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`, and volume controls from anywhere on the host machine.
  * **Auto-Pause**: Intelligently refreshes (pauses) the stream when the last user with their camera on leaves the VC or turns their camera off, saving bandwidth.

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Moderation & Automation

  * **Camera Enforcement**: Automatically mutes/deafens users without cameras in moderated VCs and applies escalating punishments for repeat violations (VC move -\> short timeout -\> long timeout).
  * **Daily Auto-Stats**: Posts a full analytics report daily at a configured UTC time, then automatically clears all statistics for the next day.
  * **Media-Only Channels**: Enforces rules in designated channels by automatically deleting any messages that do not contain an image, video, link, or other media.
  * **Comprehensive Logging**: Utilizes `loguru` for detailed, color-coded logs of all commands, moderation actions, and server events, saved to `bot.log`.

### üéµ Integrated Music System

  * **Versatile Playback**: Search / play songs or playlists from **YouTube** / **Spotify** / local files.
  * **Interactive Queue**: View the song queue with `!q` and instantly jump to any song using a dropdown menu.
  * **Persistent Playlists**: Save the current queue as a named playlist, then load, list, or delete playlists at any time.
  * **Multiple Playback Modes**: Effortlessly cycle between **Shuffle**, **Alphabetical**, and **Loop** modes.
  * **Automatic Management**: The bot joins the VC when users with cameras are present and leaves when it's empty to conserve resources.

### üìä Persistent State & Analytics

  * **State Persistence**: All critical data‚Äîstats, violations, timeouts, event history, and playlists‚Äîis saved to `data.json` and reloaded on startup, ensuring no data is lost after a crash or restart.
  * **VC Time Tracking**: Tracks the cumulative time users spend in moderated voice channels, with daily leaderboards available via the `!times` command.

### üîî Comprehensive Event Notifications

The bot keeps administrators informed with a robust, event-driven notification system. It uses rich, detailed embeds to provide real-time updates for all significant server activities:

  * **Member Activity**: Joins, Leaves (batched for mass departures), Kicks, Bans, and Unbans.
  * **Moderation Actions**: Timeouts Added/Removed and Role Changes.
  * **Bot & Stream Status**: Bot Online, Stream Auto-Pause, and Browser Health notifications.

      * ‚úÖ **Message Content Intent**

6.  Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server.

### 3\. Set up Spotify API (Optional)

To enable playing songs, albums, and playlists from Spotify links, you need API credentials.

## Running the Bot

1.  **Important**: Close all running instances of the Microsoft Edge browser.
2.  Open your command prompt, navigate to the bot's folder (`cd path/to/your/bot`), and run the bot:

    ```
    python bot.py
    ```
4.  The bot will launch Edge, navigate to your configured URL, and initialize all systems.

### Troubleshooting

  * **Token Error**: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly named (it must be `.env`, not `env.txt`), is in the same folder as `bot.py`, and contains the correct Discord bot token.
  * **Edge Won't Launch**: Double-check that the `EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR` path in `config.py` is absolutely correct and matches your system.
  * **"WebDriver" Error**: Make sure your Edge browser is fully updated. Selenium's automatic driver management requires an up-to-date browser.
  * **Music Doesn't Play**: Confirm that **FFmpeg** is installed and its location is included in your system's PATH environment variable.
  * **Spotify Links Fail**: Check your `.env` file to ensure the `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct and have no extra spaces.
  * **Other Issues**: Check the `bot.log` file in the bot's folder for detailed error messages.
