## ‚ú® Key Features

### üåê Interactive Stream Control

* **Intuitive Button Menus**: Users control the stream (`!skip`, `!refresh`, `!report`, `!rules`) and music (`!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`, `!mshuffle`, `!mclear`) with persistent button menus. Requires being in the Streaming VC with camera on for most actions (except for Allowed Users). The music menu dynamically updates with the current song, playback status, mode, volume, and queue length. Includes an auto-updating leaderboard for top VC users (`!times`).
* **Global Hotkeys**: Configure system-wide keyboard shortcuts to trigger commands like `!skip`, `!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`, and volume controls from anywhere on the host machine.
* **Auto-Start**: Automatically starts the stream by running `!skip` as soon as the first user joins the streaming VC with their camera on (configurable).
* **Auto-Pause**: Intelligently triggers a browser page refresh (`!refresh` / pause command) *only* when the last user with their camera on leaves the VC or turns their camera off, saving bandwidth. The bot also automatically handles common elements like terms checkboxes after a refresh.
* **Public Action Feed**: Button commands like `!skip` are announced publicly in the command channel (with auto-delete) for better transparency.

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Moderation & Automation

* **Camera Enforcement**: Automatically mutes/deafens users without cameras in moderated VCs and applies escalating punishments for repeat violations (VC move -> short timeout -> long timeout).
* **`!move` Command**: Admins or designated roles can move users from the Streaming VC to the Punishment VC (e.g., for sleeping), with automatic notifications and cooldowns for non-owners.
* **Automatic Ban Handling**: Periodically captures browser screenshots. When a ban is detected, it saves the recent screenshots locally, **posts them to a Discord channel** (configurable, auto-deleted after 2 minutes), and logs details (including users present in the streaming VC) to a dedicated `ban.log` file.
* **Clean Command Channel**: Automatically deletes old command messages (after ~1 min) to keep the control channel tidy, while preserving the interactive menus.
* **Daily Auto-Stats**: Posts a voice channel time report (`!times`) daily at a configured UTC time, then automatically clears VC time, command usage, and violation statistics for the next day.
* **Media-Only Channels**: Enforces rules in designated channels by automatically deleting any messages that do not contain an image, video, link, or other media.
* **Comprehensive Logging**: Utilizes `loguru` for detailed, color-coded logs of all commands, moderation actions, and server events, saved to `bot.log`. Includes a separate, persistent `ban.log` for ban-specific events, featuring auto-rotation and compression. Status messages and critical errors (like **VC connection failures**) can be sent to a dedicated Discord log channel (configurable via `LOG_GC`).

### üéµ Integrated Music System

* **Versatile Playback**: Search / play songs or playlists from **YouTube** / **Spotify** / local files. Filters unavailable/deleted videos during search and playlist processing.
* **Interactive Queue**: View the song queue with `!q` and instantly jump to any song using a dropdown menu.
* **Persistent Playlists**: Save the current queue as a named playlist, then load, list, or delete playlists at any time.
* **Multiple Playback Modes**: Effortlessly cycle between **Shuffle**, **Alphabetical**, and **Loop** modes.
* **Automatic Management**: The bot joins the VC when users with cameras are present and leaves when it's empty to conserve resources. Includes a watchdog task to ensure playback resumes if it unexpectedly stops.
* **Dynamic Menu**: The interactive music control menu updates in real-time to show the current song, playback status, volume, mode, and queue length.

### üìä Persistent State & Analytics

* **State Persistence**: All critical data‚Äîstats, violations, timeouts, event history, playlists, window geometry, moderation settings, and menu message IDs‚Äîis saved to `data.json` and reloaded on startup, ensuring no data is lost after a crash or restart.
* **VC Time Tracking**: Tracks the cumulative time users spend in moderated voice channels, with daily leaderboards available via the `!times` command (also shown in the command channel menu).

### üîî Comprehensive Event Notifications

The bot keeps administrators informed with a robust, event-driven notification system. It uses rich, detailed embeds to provide real-time updates for all significant server activities:

* **Member Activity**: Joins, Leaves (batched for mass departures), Kicks, Bans, and Unbans.
* **Moderation Actions**: Timeouts Added/Removed, Role Changes, **VC Moves**.
* **Bot & Stream Status**: Bot Online, Stream Auto-Pause/Start, Browser Health (including **VC connection errors** sent to the configured `LOG_GC` channel), and Omegle Ban/Unban status notifications (including **pre-ban screenshots posted to Discord**).

## Running the Bot

1.  **Important**: Close all running instances of the Microsoft Edge browser. This ensures the bot can take control of the user data directory properly.

2.  Open your command prompt or terminal.

3.  Navigate to the folder where you saved the bot files using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd C:\Users\YourUser\Desktop\SkipCord`).

4.  Run the bot using Python:

    ```
    python bot.py
    ```

5.  The bot should now start, log its initialization steps in the console, automatically launch Edge, navigate to your configured URL, and set up the interactive menus in Discord.

### Troubleshooting

  * **Token Error / Login Failure**: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly named (it must be `.env`, not `env.txt`), is in the same folder as `bot.py`, and contains the correct Discord bot token copied from the Developer Portal. Make sure there are no extra spaces.
  * **Edge Won't Launch / `user data directory is already in use`**: Double-check that **all** Edge browser windows and background processes are completely closed before starting the bot. Verify the `EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR` path in `config.py` is absolutely correct (use forward slashes `/` even on Windows) and points to the *parent* directory of `Default` or `Profile X`.
  * **"WebDriver" Error / Version Mismatch**: Make sure your Edge browser is fully updated (`edge://settings/help`). Selenium usually downloads the correct driver automatically. If you get persistent errors mentioning version mismatches, you can manually download the correct `msedgedriver.exe` for your specific Edge version from the [Microsoft Edge WebDriver page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) and specify its full path (including `msedgedriver.exe`) in `config.py` via the `EDGE_DRIVER_PATH` setting.
  * **Music Doesn't Play / "FFmpeg not found"**: Confirm that **FFmpeg** is installed correctly and that the folder containing `ffmpeg.exe` is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable. You might need to restart your terminal or PC after updating the PATH. Check `bot.log` for specific FFmpeg errors during playback attempts.
  * **Spotify Links Fail**: Check your `.env` file to ensure the `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct, copied directly from the Spotify Developer Dashboard, and have no extra spaces.
  * **VC Connection Errors in `LOG_GC`**: If you see messages about failing to connect, check the bot's permissions in Discord. Ensure it has the "Connect" and "Speak" permissions for the `STREAMING_VC_ID`.
  * **Buttons Don't Work / Commands Fail**: Check the console output and `bot.log` for any error messages immediately after trying to use a command or button. Ensure you meet the requirements (e.g., in VC with camera on). Check if the user might be command-disabled (`!timeouts`).
  * **Other Issues**: Check the `bot.log` and `ban.log` files in the bot's folder for detailed error messages. Check the configured `LOG_GC` channel in Discord (if set) for status messages and critical errors.
