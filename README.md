# SkipCord-2: Omegle Streaming & Music Bot for Discord

SkipCord-2 is a powerful, fully modular Discord bot designed for streamers who use Omegle or similar platforms. It allows streamers to share their experience in a Discord voice channel, giving everyone control via an interactive button menu. The bot includes advanced moderation, detailed logging, automated rule enforcement, and a complete music bot feature set, all built on a fully asynchronous architecture for rock-solid performance.

## Key Features

### **Stream Controls & User Experience**

* **Interactive Button Menus**: Users can control the stream (`!skip`, `!info`) and music (`!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`) with clean, persistent button menus that refresh periodically.
* **VC Time Tracking**: Tracks the cumulative time users spend in moderated voice channels, with daily leaderboards via the `!times` command.
* **Auto-Pause**: Automatically refreshes (pauses) the stream when the last user with their camera on leaves the VC or turns their camera off.
* **Global Hotkeys**: Configure keyboard shortcuts to trigger commands like `!skip`, `!mskip`, `!mpauseplay`, and volume controls from anywhere on the host machine.
* **State Persistence**: All critical data (stats, violations, timeouts, event history, playlists) is saved to a `data.json` file and reloaded on startup, ensuring no data is lost on restart or crash.

### **Advanced Moderation & Automation**

* **Camera Enforcement**:
    * Non-admin users without cameras in a moderated VC are automatically muted/deafened.
    * **1st Violation**: User is moved to a designated punishment VC.
    * **2nd Violation**: User receives a short timeout.
    * **3rd+ Violations**: User receives a longer timeout.
* **Media-Only Channel**: Automatically deletes any messages in a designated channel that do not contain an image, video, link, or other media attachment.
* **Daily Auto-Stats**: Posts a full analytics report (VC time, command usage, etc.) daily at a configured UTC time, then automatically clears all statistics for the next day.
* **Comprehensive Logging**: Uses `loguru` for detailed, color-coded logs of all commands, moderation actions, and server events, saved to `bot.log`.

### **Full Music Bot Integration** üéµ

* **YouTube & Local File Support**: Play songs from YouTube URLs, search terms, or a local music library.
* **Interactive Queue**: View the song queue with `!q` and jump to any song using a dropdown menu.
* **Playlist System**: Save the current queue as a named playlist, then load, list, or delete playlists.
* **Multiple Playback Modes**: Cycle between Shuffle, Alphabetical (for local files), and Loop modes.
* **Automatic Management**: The bot automatically joins the VC when users with cameras are present and leaves when it's empty to save resources.

### **Comprehensive Event Notifications**

The bot ensures administrators are always informed with a robust, event-driven notification system. Using rich, detailed embeds sent to a designated chat channel, it provides real-time updates for all significant server activities.

* **Member Activity**: Joins, Leaves (batched for mass departures), Kicks, Bans, and Unbans.
* **Moderation Actions**: Timeouts Added/Removed and Role Changes.
* **Bot & Stream Status**: Bot Online, Stream Auto-Pause, and Browser Health notifications.

## Setup & Configuration

### 1) Prerequisites

    ```

### 2) Create a Discord Bot

1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application/bot.
2.  Navigate to the "Bot" tab and enable the following **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
    * **Message Content Intent**
    * **Server Members Intent**
3.  Copy your **Bot Token** and keep it secret.
4.  Go to the "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator" tab. Select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
5.  In the "Bot Permissions" section below, select `Administrator`.
6.  Copy the generated URL and use it to invite your bot to your server.

### 3) File Setup

1.  Create a folder for your bot and place all the python files (`bot.py`, `helper.py`, `omegle.py`, `tools.py`), your `config.py`, and `requirements.txt` inside.
2.  Create a new file named `.env` in the same folder.
3.  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `your_token_here` with your actual bot token:
    `BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here`

### 4) Configure `config.py`

Open `config.py` and replace the placeholder values with your server's specific IDs and settings. You can get these IDs by enabling Developer Mode in Discord, then right-clicking on a server, channel, or user and selecting "Copy ID".

```

### 5) Running the Bot

1.  **Important**: Close all currently running instances of the Microsoft Edge browser.
2.  Open your command prompt, navigate to the bot's folder (`cd path/to/your/bot`), and run the bot using:
    `python bot.py`
3.  The bot will launch Edge, navigate to the configured URL, and start all monitoring systems.
4.  **Troubleshooting**:
    * If the bot fails with a token error, ensure your `.env` file is correct and in the same folder.
    * If Edge doesn't launch, double-check that the `EDGE_USER_DATA_DIR` path in `config.py` is correct.
    * If you get a "webdriver" error, ensure your Edge browser is fully updated.
    * If music doesn't play, ensure **FFmpeg** is correctly installed and in your system's PATH.
    * Check the `bot.log` file for any specific error messages.
